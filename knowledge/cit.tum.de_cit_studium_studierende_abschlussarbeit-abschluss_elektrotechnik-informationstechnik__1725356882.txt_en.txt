A letter of admission, which confirms the fulfillment of the admission requirements, is necessary for registration.
You can personally request a letter of admission to the Bachelor’s Thesis module during the office hours of the Academic and Student Affairs Office (Deptartment of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology) or by sending them an email.
Thesis supervisors are to register students’ theses by means of submitting the fully filled-in form to the Academic and Student Affairs Office (Deptartment of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology).
Grades are recorded at the Academic and Student Affairs Office (Deptartment of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology) by the thesis supervisors after students fully complete their bachelor’s thesis (submission of the thesis and final presentation with the academic chair).
Please be advised that a thesis may not be registered or submitted during a semester when a student is on a leave of absence from the university – an exception will be made for a second attempt.

Scientifig Writing and Presentation: unique preparation for Bachelor thesis
Thesis and Completing your Studies in Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering > Scientifig Writing and Presentation: unique preparation for Bachelor thesis
Scientific Wirting and Presentation is a one-off 1.5-hour course that Bachelor's students can attend voluntarily in preparation for their Bachelor's thesis. The aim of the course is to optimally prepare students for planning, writing and presenting their Bachelor's thesis. The course is offered twice during the lecture period. Students who are interested can register for this one-off course via TUMonline under the module "EI1000 Bachelor Thesis" and thus gain access to the Moodle documents. The course usually takes place in presence with online transmission.
Current dates can be found under course content.

Since the period for working on the thesis significantly exceeds the time allowed for the master’s thesis (24 weeks for full-time students), the deadline cannot be extended. In cases of hardship (delays not caused by the student him/herself, e.g., due to prolonged illness or hospitalization), please consult the Examination Board during the office hours of the board’s secretary.

Master’s theses written in collaboration with external institutions
Thesis and Completing your Studies in Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering > Master’s theses written in collaboration with external institutions
When a master’s thesis is written in collaboration with an external institution, difficulties frequently arise.
For this reason, please adhere to the following instructions:
- External institutions and companies offer students topics and projects which, according to their call for applications, are suitable for use as a basis for their master's thesis.
- Caution! Assigning a topic for the master’s thesis and its assessment is always and exclusively the responsibility of an institution of higher education and the expert examiners of the respective degree program.
- An expert examiner of the program is required for the registration, realization and assessment of all master’s theses.
- Students should not assume that they will be able to obtain suitable academic supervision by an expert examiner from a TUM degree program for their preferred topic while writing their master’s thesis in collaboration with an external institution. 	 		This will especially be the case if students have already agreed to contractual obligations with an external institution or have already begun working on a master’s thesis without registering their thesis in advance.
- This will especially be the case if students have already agreed to contractual obligations with an external institution or have already begun working on a master’s thesis without registering their thesis in advance.
- If no expert examiner from the department is willing to supervise the student’s proposed topic, the student will have to choose one of the topics that are proposed by the academic chair/professors in the TUM Deptartment of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology or another topic will have to be chosen with a cooperation partner.
- As a rule, expert examiners from a department do not sign confidentiality agreements related to the written thesis or the final presentation. 	 		However, we recommend that our students enter into a written agreement with external institutions so they can submit a master’s thesis and give their final presentation within the scope of the Master’s Thesis module. 		TUM/ the degree program does not offer any legal advice on contracts or agreements between students and external institutions.
- However, we recommend that our students enter into a written agreement with external institutions so they can submit a master’s thesis and give their final presentation within the scope of the Master’s Thesis module.
- TUM/ the degree program does not offer any legal advice on contracts or agreements between students and external institutions.
- The copyright of the master’s thesis remains with the students (unless a student assigns this right to someone else in a contract).
- It should be noted that the oral presentation of the master’s thesis is always open to the university community, regardless of any contractual agreements.
- Because there are several contact persons involved (contacts and co-advisors at an external institution and the expert examiner from the degree program), it is especially important for potential conflicts to be clarified directly with the expert examiner for the program early on and for a work schedule to be agreed upon with intermediary goals and meetings.
- When students write a thesis in cooperation with an industry partner or another research-related institution, they often have to sign a student employment contract with remuneration. You should be aware that this means you will have to do more work beyond your master’s thesis (full-time work).
- While working at this external institution, if you notice that you are doing work that is not related to the thesis or is not covered by a student employment contract, you should inform your supervisor at the external institution without delay. If the problem does not get resolved, please contact your advisor at TUM and request a meeting with everyone involved.
- When you register your thesis, you must confirm that you were informed of potential difficulties when writing a thesis in collaboration with an external institution.

FAQs
Thesis and Completing your Studies in Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering > FAQs
How many ECTS credits do I need before I can register for the master’s thesis (PO20201)?
A: Students should have already earned all of the other credits. The master’s thesis is the last examination credit to be earned in a student’s studies.
Can the master’s thesis be written in collaboration with a company or a research-related institute (e.g., Fraunhofer)?
A: Generally speaking, yes, it is possible to complete the master’s thesis with an expert examiner from MSEI; only the expert examiner is responsible for setting the topic, supervision and assessment of the thesis.
What is the minimal/maximum period of time allowed for working on the master’s thesis (PO20201)?
A: Thirty credits will be awarded for the master’s thesis. This is the equivalent to a full-time workload of 6 months. This period also includes the time needed for the oral presentation.
