How is the program structured?
Sprachhinweis > How is the program structured?
The unique feature of the master’s program Mathematics in Data Science is the great variety of specialization topics, such as machine learning, numerical analysis, optimization, statistics, topological data analysis and manifold intersectional topics. In the first year, students start with foundational overview courses discussing a range of data science topics before choosing individual focus areas from our diverse set of possible specializations. Besides the core training on the mathematical foundations and applied aspects, the program also includes courses on legal aspects and the societal and political implications of data science. In addition, many students participate in the TUM Data Innovation Lab, in which they work on real world problems in collaboration with companies or research groups at TUM. The flexible structure of the program facilitates studying at one of TUM’s partner universities abroad for one or two semesters. The program concludes with a master’s thesis in the fourth semester that is typically written under the guidance of a professor in mathematics, computer science, or computer engineering.
