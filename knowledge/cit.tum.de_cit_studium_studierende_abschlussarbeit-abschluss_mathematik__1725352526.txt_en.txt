When and where?
Thesis and Completing your Studies in Mathematics > Registration > When and where?
It is possible to register your thesis on the 1st and 15th of each month.
All final theses starting from 1st February 2024 onwards in the PP Mathematics at the School of Computation, Information and Technology will be managed via the CIT portal.
Once you have found a topic and a supervising chair for your thesis, you will be registered by the supervising chair. You will receive an e-mail asking you to confirm your thesis registration. Only after you have confirmed your registration the Academic Programmes Office will be able to check the admission requirements and you will receive an email confirming your binding registration for your thesis.

Once you have completed all the requirements for your degree, we will contact you by email and ask for the approval to issue your diploma certificate.

Graduation documents and preliminary certificates
Thesis and Completing your Studies in Mathematics > Completing your Studies > Graduation documents and preliminary certificates
After you have given us the approval for the generating of your diploma certificate, your graduation documents will be generated within 4 - 6 weeks at the Graduation Office and Academic Records Campus Garching. You will be notified by post as soon as your certificate has been issued. Please make sure that your current study address in TUMonline is up to date.
If required, you can also apply to the Graduation Office and Academic Records Campus Garching for a preliminary certificate.

Transition Bachelor – Master
Thesis and Completing your Studies in Mathematics > Completing your Studies > Transition Bachelor – Master
If you have applied for a consecutive mathematics Master's program at our school after completing your TUM mathematics Bachelor's degree, please let us know (at bachelor(at)ma.tum.de). It is possible to forward your Bachelor's degree to the Admissions and Enrollment Office for enrollment (not for the application!). The graduation documents are therefore not necessary for enrollment. A green checkmark will then appear in the online application portal for your degree certificate and diploma (Application Status). Please note that it may take a few days until the documents are updated in the portal. If you do not see these two green check marks one week before the enrollment deadline, please contact bachelor(at)ma.tum.de as soon as possible.
