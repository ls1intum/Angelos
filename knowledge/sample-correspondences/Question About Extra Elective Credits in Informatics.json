Are there any consequences for exceeding the credits, particularly the free electives, and can we choose the courses we want on our transcript if we do exceed the limit?\""

Out of the 53 ECTS elective credits, you must ensure that 10 ECTS come from THEO modules. There are no negative consequences for exceeding the required ECTS; you can select which courses count toward your GPA when you complete your studies."
