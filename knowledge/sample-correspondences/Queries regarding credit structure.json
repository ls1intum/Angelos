Do I still need to complete three areas (Major, two minors), or is it enough to complete 53 credits under Elective modules? I have also completed a Major in Engineering software-intensive systems (18 credits) and a minor in Machine learning and analytics (12 credits). Do the extra 4 credits from the MLA minor count towards the Electives? Is there still a requirement for one area to be in FMA?\""

The extra credits can come from either area (specialization or supplemental) or electives from any subject area. It appears that you may be referencing an old version of the Master's structure; please refer to the current version available here: https://www.cit.tum.de/en/cit/studies/degree-programs/master-informatics/curriculum/. I hope this helps!"
