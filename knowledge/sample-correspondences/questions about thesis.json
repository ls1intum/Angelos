As far as I know, the supervisor does the registering. 2) Does the 4 months begin directly after registering or can I begin some time after registering? 3) If I want to begin my master's in the summer semester, until when must my thesis be finished?\""

The 4 months begin on the date entered by the supervisor in the CIT portal, who can register your thesis up to 2 weeks in advance. Ideally, your thesis should be finished and graded by the end of the winter semester (March/beginning of April) to start your master's in the summer."
