Information on the modules required for the master's degree can be found in Appendix 2 of the FPSO for the degree program, which you can view here: https://www.cit.tum.de/cit/studium/studiengaenge/master-robotics-cognition-intelligence/ under the section Examinations and Regulations. The Application and Admissions section is also of interest to you."
