However, I was rejected because I have to have both a bachelor's and a master's degree from a university. I am wondering if I can get credits transferred to TU Munich, as I have collected over 330 credits that are equivalent to many of the computer science courses at TU Munich. Could you give me a rough estimate of how many credits could be transferred, or if you know of any similar cases?\""
