Basic Information on exam registration
Examination Matters and Modules > Basic Information on exam registration
- Registration for examination must be done via TUMonline.
- Registration for a course does NOT mean you are automatically registered for the respective examination.
- Separate, advance registration must be made via TUMonline EVERY time you take an examination (including retake exams). The only exception are mid-term exams. If you registered for a mid-term exam, then you will be automatically registered for the final exam.
- Taking an examination does not replace registration. If you do not register for an exam in TUMonline, the credits will not count towards to your degree program.
- Please pay attention to further information given by your lecturers and teaching staff. Additional on-site registration may be necessary for some examinations.
- Don't forget to check if your registration has been succesfull befor the end of the registration period. How you can find out to which examinations you are registrated please look at bulletpoint "How can I see the exams I am registered for?"
