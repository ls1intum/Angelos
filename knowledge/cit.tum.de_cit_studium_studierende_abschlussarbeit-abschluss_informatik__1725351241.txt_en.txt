Visibility in TUMonline (Registration and Submission)
Thesis and Completing your Studies in Informatics > Visibility in TUMonline (Registration and Submission)
How can I see in TUMonline that my thesis is registered?
On your personal overview page in TUMonline, you will find the application "Student Files" in the section "Studies and Courses". If you click on it, you will get to your student file, where there is also a tab "Degrees". In the lower part of this tab you will find your thesis, if you are already registered. If you hold the cursor over the orange dot, your submission date will be displayed.
Alternatively, you can go to your "Curriculum Support" via the tile "Study Status/Curriculum". If you expand the entry "Bachelor'sThesis" with the "Plus" twice, you will see a note that the thesis is registered.
When we have received your thesis and registered your submission, this will also be displayed there.

Extension
Thesis and Completing your Studies in Informatics > Extension
If you are unable to meet the submission deadline of your thesis for valid reasons for which you are not responsible, you can submit an application for an extension of the thesis to the Examination Board.
The application must be submitted immediately to the secretary responsible for your degree program, by email from your TUM account. If possible, please fill in and sign the form digitally. Medical certificates also have to be submitted in original (by post). The processing time after submission of all documents is usually two weeks, and you will be notified of the Examination Board's decision.
Applications can generally be divided into two categories:
1) Health reasons
If you are ill and can prove by a certificate that you are prevented from working on your thesis, the processing time is suspended. In the Department of Informatics, this is represented by an extension of your submission deadline. A medical certificate must be enclosed with the application in original. A certificate of incapacity for work is not sufficient. You can find the requirements for a certificate on the website Withdrawing from Examinations – Medical Certificates.
Request for an Extension for Health Reasons
2) Other reasons
In cases of delays due to other valid reasons for which you are not responsible, the submission deadline of your thesis may be extended in exceptional and particularly justified cases in agreement with the thesis examiner and with the approval of the Examination Board. Please enclose a detailed justification (if possible with supporting documents) with your application.

Release of final certificate
Thesis and Completing your Studies in Informatics > Completing your Studies > Release of final certificate
Please contact the secretary of the Examination Board of your study program via e-mail for the release of your Bachelor's degree documents when all grades have been entered and validly set. For enrollment in consecutive Master's programs in Informatics at TUM, the following applies: From mid-September and mid-March respectively, the graduation will be reported directly to the Enrollment Office after the release of the transcripts, so that the graduation documents are no longer necessary for enrollment.

Graduation documents and preliminary certificates
Thesis and Completing your Studies in Informatics > Completing your Studies > Graduation documents and preliminary certificates
Please be aware that graduation documents and preliminary certificates can only be issued when all grades in TUMonline (including the thesis) are validated. Certificates for students of the Faculty for Informatics  are issued by the Graduation Office and Academic Records Campus Garching exclusively, after approval by the Examination Board. Please contact the Secretary of the Examination Board of your study program as soon as all your grades are validated. (Responsible Secretary of the Examination Board: see section "Contact" on the webpage for your study program)

Transition Bachelor – Master
Thesis and Completing your Studies in Informatics > Completing your Studies > Transition Bachelor – Master
If you enroll for a consecutive Master's program at the Department of Informatics after your Bachelor's degree, we will forward your bachelor's degree to the Admissions and Enrollment Office for enrollment (not for the application!). The graduation documents are therefore not necessary for enrollment. A green checkmark will then appear in the online application portal for your degree certificate and diploma. Please note that it may take a few days until the documents are updated in the portal. If you do not see these two green check marks 1 week before the enrollment deadline, please contact the secretary of the examination board as soon as possible.
Please find more information under graduation.
