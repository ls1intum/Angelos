----------------------------------------

The Master of Science in Communications and Electronics Engineering (MSCE) is a two-year high-level international graduate program.
Twenty-first century society is shaped emphatically by the ability to communicate with each other anytime and anywhere. Ubiquitous cell phones, broadband Internet connections and networked production processes are signs of this development and will continue to develop in the long term with the widespread introduction of 5G and the planned introduction of 6G. In addition to the technological challenge, the economic and political environment define the context of this development. Secure communications technology based on microelectronics and nanoelectronics is an essential foundation for our future society. Communications technology has long become a key technology beyond the communications industry in the narrower sense, e.g. for networking in and between vehicles, for innovative healthcare services, for the "Internet of Things" and for "Industry 4.0".
The master's degree program in Communications and Electronics Engineering therefore aims to provide a research-oriented education for engineers whose task is to continuously develop state-of-the-art technologies in the communications technology and electronics sector, to open up new research areas in these fields and, due to the international orientation of the program, to contribute worldwide to finding solutions for current challenges in the field of communications and electronics.
Applicants must hold a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering (or equivalent) with specialization in communications engineering and have an international background.
