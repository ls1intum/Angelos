Preparatory and Vacation Courses Mathematics
Preparatory and Vacation Courses Mathematics
Well prepared for your studies: The TUM School of Computation, Information and Technology (CIT) offers preparatory mathematics courses for those with vocational qualifications and other first-year students. They help you get started at the university and give you the opportunity to get to know future fellow students in advance and to find your way around the TUM Campus. Enrolled students also have the opportunity to prepare for the next semester – with the introductory seminar L&L, in-depth vacation courses or the vacation seminar of the Hurwitz Society

Courses for vocationally qualified students
Preparatory and Vacation Courses Mathematics > Courses for vocationally qualified students
Students with vocational qualifications (e.g. apprenticeships) must take a test on their math knowledge in order to receive subject-related eligibility for university admission. As preparation for the test, the CIT offers a preparatory course once a year. The course takes place on the Research Campus - Garching.
Please find all current information at Course for vocationally qualified students.

Precourses for first-year students
Preparatory and Vacation Courses Mathematics > Precourses for first-year students
TUM offers first-year students preliminary courses for various fields of study such as mathematics, physics, informatics, electrical engineering and information technology, engineering, aerospace and management. The courses are a perfect introduction to successful studies and therefore highly recommended by th CIT.
The precourses are not compulsory and not a prerequisite. The lectures of your study program are based on the general Abitur knowledge.
Please find all information on the respective course page (courses held in German have German titles):
- Precourse Mathematics for Electrical Engineering (in German)
- Precourse Mathematics for Informatics (in German and English)(Study programs B.Sc. Informatics, Informatics: Games Engineering, Information Systems, Bioinformatics)
- Precourse Mathematics for Management & Technology, Aerospace, Science & Engineering, Geodesy & Geoinformation (in English)(Study programs B.Sc. Management & Technology, Aerospace, Science & Engineering, Geodesy & Geoinformation)
- Precourse in Advanced Mathematics for Mechanical Engineering, Engineering Sciences, Geodesy (in German)(Study programs B.Sc. Mechanical Engineering, Engineering Science, Chemical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Environmental Engineering, Geodesy)
- Precourse Mathematics for Mathematics and Physics (in German)

L&L – getting started with your studies
Preparatory and Vacation Courses Mathematics > L&L – getting started with your studies
The course Lehr- und Lernformen (L&L – Teaching & Learning) is conceived for all first-year students of mathematics and takes place within the Study Introductory Days (SET: Studieneinführungstage). During the SET Days, you will get to know the TUM and the Garching campus and make first contacts with fellow students. The practice lecture, exercise classes and group work within L&L will make it easier for you to start your studies at the CIT.
Please find all current information at Lehr- und Lernformen (L&L – Teaching & Learning).

Vacation courses
Preparatory and Vacation Courses Mathematics > Vacation courses
Deepen your knowledge, repeat tricky topics and have your questions answered - vacation courses are ideal for those who want to prepare themselves for exams or need an introduction to software for mathematicians. The courses are a supplementary offer of our department, financed via study subsidies.
You are not required to attend. Also, we do not provide you any new teaching material you need to pass your exam. There are a number of one-day or several-day vacation courses on offer. Further information and the program can be found under vacation courses.

Vacation seminar of the Hurwitz Society
Preparatory and Vacation Courses Mathematics > Vacation seminar of the Hurwitz Society
A seminar in an informal atmosphere: Every year in fall, the Hurwitz Society for the promotion of mathematics at the TUM offers a vacation seminar for all students from the fourth semester on. It offers you the opportunity to listen to lectures, exchange professional ideas and get to know your lecturers better. The vacation seminar can be credited to your bachelor studies just like a regular seminar.
