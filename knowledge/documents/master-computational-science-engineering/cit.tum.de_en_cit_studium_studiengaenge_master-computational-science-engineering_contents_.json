You are free to decide when to take which mandatory and elective subjects. If you have any doubts about the structure of your studies, please contact the CSE coordinators at coordinators(at)cse.tum.de.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nExemplary study plan\nContents of the Degree Program > Exemplary study plan\nIn the following we give an exemplary study plan for students who have started in the winter term 2021/22.\nThe computer science catalog is divided into a mandatory part (Advanced Programming, Parallel Programming) and an elective part (Visual Data Analytics, Patterns in Software Engineering, Fundamental Algorithms, Computer Architecture and Networks). At least 10 ECTS have to be acquired from the elective part of computer science (each of the modules has 5 ECTS)\nAt least 16 ECTS have to be completed from Section B (Numerical Analysis).\nModules in Sections D & E are chosen individually by each student (at least 8 ECTS from D, details under Elective Modules).\nFirst semester (Mid October - Mid February, 29 ECTS)\nTable (Contents of the Degree Program > Exemplary study plan):\nA: Computer Science | B: Numerical Analysis | C: Scientific Computing\nIN1503 Advanced Programming | MA3305 Numerical Programming I | IN2005 Scientific Computing I\nComputer Science elective 1 | IN2182 Scientific Computing Lab\n\nSecond semester (Mid April to end of July, 31 ECTS)\nTable (Contents of the Degree Program > Exemplary study plan):\nA: Computer Science | B: Numerical Analysis | C: Scientific Computing | D: CSE Applications\nIN2147 Parallel Programming | MA3306 Numerical Programming II | IN2141 Scientific Computing II | Application elective 1\nIN2397 Advanced Practical Course \t\t\tComputational Science and Engineering\n\nThird semester (Mid October - Mid February, 30 ECTS)\nTable (Contents of the Degree Program > Exemplary study plan):\nA: Computer Science | C: Scientific Computing | D: CSE Applications | E: Further Electives\nComputer science elective 2 | IN2183 CSE Seminar Scientific Computing | Application elective 2 | Further elective 1\nApplication elective 3 | Further elective 2\n\nFourth semester The final semester will be devoted to the master's thesis. You can choose to conduct your thesis at one of TUM’s partner institutions or at an external company, if desired.\nExemplary study plan\n----------------------------------------\n\nExemplary study plans for students who have started before winter term 2020/21\nContents of the Degree Program > Exemplary study plans for students who have started before winter term 2020/21\nThe computer science catalog is split in a mandatory part (Advanced Programming, Parallel Programming) and an elective part (Visual Data Analytics, Programming of Supercomputers, Patterns in Software Engineering, Fundamental Algorithms, Computer Architecture and Networks). 15 ECTS from the elective part of computer science have to be earned (each of the modules has 5 ECTS)\nModules in Sections D & E are chosen individually by each student (min 6 ECTS from two different catalogs each, at least one D catalog, details see under Elective Modules).\nFirst semester (Mid October - Mid February, 29 ECTS )\nTable (Contents of the Degree Program > Exemplary study plans for students who have started before winter term 2020/21):\nA: Computer Science | B: Numerical Analysis | C: Scientific Computing\nIN1503 Advanced Programming | MA3305 Numerical Programming I | IN2005 Scientific Computing I\nComputer Science elective 1 |   | IN2182 Scientific Computing Lab\n\nSecond semester (Mid April to end of July, 30 ECTS)\nTable (Contents of the Degree Program > Exemplary study plans for students who have started before winter term 2020/21):\nA: Computer Science | B: Numerical Analysis | C: Scientific Computing | D & E: Applications, Methods and Techniques\nIN2147 Parallel Programming | MA3306 Numerical Programming II | IN2141 Scientific Computing II | Application area elective 1\nApplication area elective 2\n\nThird semester (Mid October - Mid February, 31 ECTS)\nTable (Contents of the Degree Program > Exemplary study plans for students who have started before winter term 2020/21):\nA: Computer Science | B: Numerical Analysis | C: Scientific Computing | D & E: Applications, Methods and Techniques\nComputer science elective 2 | IN2012 Parallel Numerics | IN2183 CSE Seminar Scientific Computing | Application area elective 3\nComputer science elective 3 | Application area elective 4\n\nFourth semester The final semester will be devoted to the master's thesis.
