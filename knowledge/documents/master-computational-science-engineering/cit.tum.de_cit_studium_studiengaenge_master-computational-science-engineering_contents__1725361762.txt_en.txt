Considering that the master's thesis usually deals with some field of application, the overall ratio between basic subjects and application-related subjects is approximately 50/50.
Below you can see the most common (and recommended) structure for your CSE studies, but you do not have to follow it. You are free to decide when to take which mandatory and elective subjects. If you have any doubts about the structure of your studies, please contact the CSE coordinators at coordinators(at)cse.tum.de.

Exemplary study plan
Contents of the Degree Program > Exemplary study plan
In the following we give an exemplary study plan for students who have started in the winter term 2021/22.
The computer science catalog is divided into a mandatory part (Advanced Programming, Parallel Programming) and an elective part (Visual Data Analytics, Patterns in Software Engineering, Fundamental Algorithms, Computer Architecture and Networks). At least 10 ECTS have to be acquired from the elective part of computer science (each of the modules has 5 ECTS)
At least 16 ECTS have to be completed from Section B (Numerical Analysis).
Modules in Sections D & E are chosen individually by each student (at least 8 ECTS from D, details under Elective Modules).
First semester (Mid October - Mid February, 29 ECTS)
Table (Contents of the Degree Program > Exemplary study plan):
A: Computer Science; B: Numerical Analysis; C: Scientific Computing
IN1503 Advanced Programming; MA3305 Numerical Programming I; IN2005 Scientific Computing I
Computer Science elective 1; IN2182 Scientific Computing Lab

Second semester (Mid April to end of July, 31 ECTS)
Table (Contents of the Degree Program > Exemplary study plan):
A: Computer Science; B: Numerical Analysis; C: Scientific Computing; D: CSE Applications
