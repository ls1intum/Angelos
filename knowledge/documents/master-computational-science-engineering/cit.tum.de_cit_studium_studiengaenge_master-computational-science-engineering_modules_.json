Students are then usually working in groups on a larger project. Such a lab course has 10 ECTS and teaches a large portion of practical and soft skills.\nBelow you will find a list of lab courses that may be used for the module \"Advanced Practical Course CSE\" (IN2397). Please note that the lab courses listed on this site may not be offered regularly and may be canceled or replaced. As is the case with all courses, you may not know if an internship will be offered until only a few weeks before the start of the semester. The following table is subject to change and only includes labs that have been accepted by the Examination Board for module IN2397.\nPlease keep in mind that you can only take lab courses offered for master’s students. Lab courses offered for bachelor’s students only cannot be taken as advanced practical courses for CSE.\nRegistration for practical courses typically follows the matching process. Read more about this under \"Course registration\".\nNote that, since the advanced practical course (lab) is a mandatory module, it is not possible to take a second course to improve your grade.\nPS: If the entry below is not pointing at the current/upcoming semester, you can click \"equivalent course\" under \"Further info\" to look for updated versions of the practical course.\nTable (Section C: Advanced Practical Course CSE):\nLab course | Course ID | term |  \nEfficient Programming of Multicore Processors and Supercomputers | IN4048 (https://campus.tum.de/tumonline/pl/ui/$ctx;design=pl;header=max;lang=en/wbLv.wbShowLVDetail?pStpSpNr=950729885&pSpracheNr=2) | summer |  \nExperimental Evaluation of modern Computing Systems and Accelerators (WS24/25 TBD) | IN4294 (https://campus.tum.de/tumonline/pl/ui/$ctx;design=pl;header=max;lang=DE/wbLv.wbShowLVDetail?pStpSpNr=950733552&pSpracheNr=1) | winter/summer |  \nMachine Learning in Crowd Modeling & Simulation (NEW, from WS24/25) | IN4267 (https://campus.tum.de/tumonline/pl/ui/$ctx/wbLv.wbShowLVDetail?pStpSpNr=950763418&pSpracheNr=1) | winter/summer |  \nModern Wave Propagation - Discontinuous Galerkin & Julia | IN4280 (https://campus.tum.de/tumonline/pl/ui/$ctx;design=pl;header=max;lang=en/wbLv.wbShowLVDetail?pStpSpNr=950732572&pSpracheNr=2) | summer |  \nScientific Computing - Computational Fluid Dynamics | IN2186/IN4085 (https://campus.tum.de/tumonline/wbLv.wbShowLVDetail?pStpSpNr=950729941&pSpracheNr=2) | summer |  \nScientific Computing - High Performance Computing | IN4230 (https://campus.tum.de/tumonline/pl/ui/$ctx;design=pl;header=max;lang=en/wbLv.wbShowLVDetail?pStpSpNr=950764318&pSpracheNr=2) | winter |\nSection C: Advanced Practical Course CSE\n----------------------------------------\n\nSection C: CSE Seminar Scientific Computing\nSection C: CSE Seminar Scientific Computing\nThe seminar is a special type of module that differs from the usual lectures or lab courses. It involves the study of a selected topic under the individual guidance of a TUM researcher. Students are then usually asked to write a scientific report and give a presentation to the other participants in the seminar. The grade is often determined by both the report and the presentation.\nBelow is a list of seminars that can be used for the module \"CSE Seminar Scientific Computing\" (IN2183). Courses explicitly advertised with IN2183 or IN2183XX are always valid for the seminar module. The following table is subject to change and only includes seminars that have been accepted by the Examination Board for module IN2183. Please note that the seminars listed on this site may not always be offered regularly, and may be canceled or replaced. As is the case with all courses, you (as well as we) will only find out a few weeks before the start of the matching process (or of the semester), whether a seminar will be offered or not.\nTo find out whether a particular seminar is offered in a particular semester, please check the website of the respective chair (for example, for the chair of scientific computing I05, see https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/sccs/lehre/), as these may be updated more frequently in case of sudden changes.\nPlease keep in mind that you can only take seminars offered to master’s students. Seminars offered for bachelor’s students only (e.g. \"Proseminar\") cannot be taken as CSE seminars. Make sure to check the corresponding entry since some seminars might occasionally be offered for Bachelor students in a specific semester depending on the demands for that particular semester!\nRegistration for seminar courses (with INxxxx course IDs) typically follow the matching process. Read more about this under \"Course registration\". For the other seminars, please inquire with the respective lecturer. Registration might be possible even outside the time window for matching!\nPlease also read the general information on seminars.\nNote that, since the seminar is a mandatory module, it is not possible to take a second course to improve your grade.\nPS: If the entry below is not pointing at the current/upcoming semester, you can click \"equivalent course\" under \"Further info\" to look for updated versions of the seminar.\nTable (Section C: CSE Seminar Scientific Computing):\nSeminar | Course ID | term\nAdvanced Topics in Quantum Computing | IN2183 (https://campus.tum.de/tumonline/pl/ui/$ctx;design=pl;header=max;lang=en/wbLv.wbShowLVDetail?pStpSpNr=950765288&pSpracheNr=) | winter/summer\nCase Studies: Scientific Computing * | MA4306 (https://campus.tum.de/tumonline/WBMODHB.wbShowMHBReadOnly?pKnotenNr=1587404&pOrgNr=14178) | winter/summer\nComputational Aspects of Machine Learning | IN2183 (https://campus.tum.de/tumonline/pl/ui/$ctx;design=pl;header=max;lang=de/wbLv.wbShowLVDetail?pStpSpNr=950766941&pSpracheNr=2) | winter\nComputational Methods for Operator-Based Analysis (NEW!) * | ED140016 (https://campus.tum.de/tumonline/pl/ui/$ctx;design=pl;header=max;lang=de/WBMODHB.wbShowMHBReadOnly?pKnotenNr=3832245&pOrgNr=24208) | winter/summer\nComputational Photonics and Nanoelectronics * | EI7775 (https://campus.tum.de/tumonline/WBMODHB.wbShowMHBReadOnly?pKnotenNr=1137115&pOrgNr=14188) | winter/summer\nDeep Learning for Medical Applications | IN4860 (https://campus.tum.de/tumonline/wbLv.wbShowLVDetail?pStpSpNr=950766410&pSpracheNr=2) | winter/summer\nDeep Learning for the Natural Sciences (NEW!) | IN45051 (https://campus.tum.de/tumonline/wbLv.wbShowLVDetail?pStpSpNr=950759642&pSpracheNr=2) | winter/summer\nDeep Learning in Computer Graphics (not in WS24/25) | IN4858 (https://campus.tum.de/tumonline/wbLv.wbShowLVDetail?pStpSpNr=950758344&pSpracheNr=2) | winter/summer\nDeep Learning in Physics | IN4939 (https://campus.tum.de/tumonline/wbLv.wbShowLVDetail?pStpSpNr=950766790&pSpracheNr=2) | winter/summer\nFundamentals of Wave Simulation - Solving Hyperbolic Systems of PDEs | IN2183 (https://campus.tum.de/tumonline/wbLv.wbShowLVDetail?pStpSpNr=950767204&pSpracheNr=) | winter\nHigh Dimensional Methods in Scientific Computing | IN2183 (https://campus.tum.de/tumonline/pl/ui/$ctx;design=pl;header=max;lang=en/wbLv.wbShowLVDetail?pStpSpNr=950731360&pSpracheNr=2) | summer\nMethods for Molecular Dynamics (NEW!) | IN2183 (https://campus.tum.de/tumonline/pl/ui/$ctx;design=pl;header=max;lang=EN/wbLv.wbShowLVDetail?pStpSpNr=950774397&pSpracheNr=2&pMUISuche=FALSE) | winter\nModern Trends in High Performance Computing | IN2183 (https://campus.tum.de/tumonline/wbLv.wbShowLVDetail?pStpSpNr=950731401&pSpracheNr=) | summer\nNext-Gen Programming Interfaces and Compilers | IN4590 (https://campus.tum.de/tumonline/pl/ui/$ctx;design=pl;header=max;lang=de/wbLv.wbShowLVDetail?pStpSpNr=950763728&pSpracheNr=2) | winter\nNext Generation AI Hardware | IN4471 (https://campus.tum.de/tumonline/wbLv.wbShowLVDetail?pStpSpNr=950732402&pSpracheNr=1) | summer\nParallelisation of Physics Calculations on GPUs with CUDA * | PH1351 (https://campus.tum.de/tumonline/pl/ui/$ctx;design=pl;header=max;lang=de/WBMODHB.wbShowMHBReadOnly?pKnotenNr=645124&pOrgNr=14179) | summer\n(Performance) Portable Programming of HPC Applications | IN4472 (https://campus.tum.de/tumonline/pl/ui/$ctx;design=pl;header=max;lang=de/wbLv.wbShowLVDetail?pStpSpNr=950754429&pSpracheNr=) | summer\nQuantum Information Processing Devices (NEW!) * | CIT432005 (https://campus.tum.de/tumonline/pl/ui/$ctx/wbLv.wbShowLVDetail?pStpSpNr=950769267&pSpracheNr=1) | summer\nQuantum Networks (NEW!) * | CIT4320003 (https://campus.tum.de/tumonline/pl/ui/$ctx;design=pl;header=max;lang=DE/WBMODHB.wbShowMHBReadOnly?pKnotenNr=3576392&pOrgNr=53599) | winter/summer\nRecent Trends in 3D Computer Vision and Deep Learning | IN4826 (https://campus.tum.de/tumonline/pl/ui/$ctx;design=pl;header=max;lang=de/wbLv.wbShowLVDetail?pStpSpNr=950731580&pSpracheNr=2) | summer\n\n* Marked courses do not use the Matching platform.

Special Consideration\nA “master” list of courses in the CSE curriculum can be found in this document (last update: 25.07.2024 – This document is updated at least once every semester).\nIn addition to the courses listed above, you'll find some other courses which are suitable for CSE, but might require additional consideration, are mentioned here. For courses in these lists, it is not necessary to contact the coordinators in advance if you plan to take them. Most commonly, courses in this list:\n- might not be offered regularly (please be aware that we also don't know when a course on this list might be offered again. Instead, please reach out to the course organizer listed on the module description),\n- might be taught in German,\n- or might require a higher degree of prerequisites or be more challenging than a typical course.\nIrregular Offers and Courses Requiring Special Consideration\n----------------------------------------\n\nExample for electives calculations\nExample for electives calculations\nThis page shows the situation for students who started from the winter term 2021/22 onwards.\nPlease note: As a TUM student you can attend as many TUM courses as you want. However, only the credits (and grades) from the electives complying with CSE regulations will count for your CSE curriculum.\nAssume you attend the following courses and pass the respective exams:\nTable (Example for electives calculations):\nSection/Catalog | Course | Credits\nA | Computer Architecture and Networks | 5\nB | Numerical Programming 1 | 8\nB | Numerical Programming 2 | 8\nB | Numerical Algorithms for High Performance Computing | 8\nD4 | Computational Physics 2 | 5\nD4 | Computational Plasma Physics | 5\nD5 | Computational Methods in Nanoelectronics | 5\nE4 | Image Synthesis | 5\nE5 | Advanced Mathematical Biology | 9\nE6 | Data Mining Lab Course | 10\n\nThis selection of elective courses has 68 ECTS (>= 49) but it is not complete, as there are still credits from Section A missing (there is only one course in the example). Once another Section A course is completed (e.g., Visual Data Analytics), the Section B requirement can be fulfilled with any two of the three courses (e.g., Numerical Programming 1 & 2). As for Section D, only the selection from D4 (Computational Physics 2 + Computational Plasma Physics) is valid, as there are not enough ECTS in D5. Any selection of the rest of the courses can be used to fill in: the remaining B course, the D5 course, or any of the E courses. For example, Numerical Algorithms for High Performance Computing and Advanced Mathematical Biology could be included, such that the the D5, E4, and E6 courses appear in your transcript only as free subjects and the grades will not be reflected on your GPA.\nPlease note that you have to obtain at least 8 ECTS in a single D catalog in your transcript. Once you meet this criterion, you can choose subjects from other catalogs for the remaining (up to 15) ECTS. Some examples, assuming the 26 ECTS from Sections A and B are completed (23 ECTS are missing):\n- the combination D4 (5+5 >= 8), E4 (5), and E6 (10) is valid.\n- the combination B (8), D4 (5+5 >= 8), and E4 (5) is valid.\n- the combination B (8), D4 (5+5 >= 8), and D5 (5) is valid. (Obs: E courses can be completely avoided!)\n- the combination D4 (5), D5 (5), E4 (5) and E5 (9 >= 8) is not valid. You have to obtain 8 ECTS in a single D catalog.\n- the combination E4 (5), E5(9 >= 8) and E6 (10) is not valid. You have to obtain 8 ECTS in a single D catalog.\n- the combination D4 (5+5 >= 8), E4 (5), E5 (9) and E10 (10) is not valid. You cannot add further courses as soon as you have reached the 23 ECTS limit (at least one course needs to be removed).\nExample for electives calculations\n----------------------------------------\n\nExample for D- and E-Catalog calculation for students who have started before winter term 2020/21\nExample for D- and E-Catalog calculation for students who have started before winter term 2020/21\nPlease note: As a TUM student you can attend as many TUM courses as you want. However, only the credits (and grades) from the electives complying with CSE regulations will count for your CSE curriculum.\nSuppose you attend the following courses and pass the respective exams:\nTable (Example for D- and E-Catalog calculation for students who have started before winter term 2020/21):\nCatalog | Course | Credits\nD4 | Computational Physics 2 | 5\nD4 | Computational Plasma Physics | 5\nD5 | Computational Methods in Nanoelectronics | 5\nE4 | Image Synthesis | 5\nE5 | Advanced Mathematical Biology | 9\nE6 | Data Mining Lab Course | 10\n\nThe courses from catalogs D4 (5+5 >= 6) and E5 (9 >= 6) will appear in your CSE transcript as official choices, since for each catalog you earned more than 6 credits and one of the catalogs is a D catalog. To reach the required 23 ECTS, you can, for example, use Computational Methods in Electrodynamics. The remaining courses from E4 and E6 will appear in your transcript only as free subjects, and the grades will not be reflected on your average.\nPlease note that you have to gain at least 6 ECTS in two catalogs (at least one D catalog) in your transcript. As soon as you meet this criterion, you can also choose subjects from other catalogs. Some examples:\n- the combination D4 (5+5 >= 6), E4 (5) and E5 (9 >= 6) is valid.\n- the combination D4 (5+5 >= 6), E4 (5) and E6 (10 >= 6) is valid.\n- the combination D4 (5), D5 (5), E4 (5) and E5 (9 >= 6) is not valid. You have to obtain 6 ECTS in two catalogs (at least one D catalog).\n- the combination E4 (5), E5(9 >= 6) and E6 (10 >= 6) is not valid. One of the catalogs with 6 ECTS has to be a D catalog.\n- the combination D4 (5+5 >= 6), E4 (5) , E5 (9 >= 6) and E10 (10) is not valid. You cannot add further courses as soon as you have reached the 23 ECTS limit (at least one course needs to be removed).\nExample for D- and E-Catalog calculation for students who have started before winter term 2020/21\n----------------------------------------\n\n",
