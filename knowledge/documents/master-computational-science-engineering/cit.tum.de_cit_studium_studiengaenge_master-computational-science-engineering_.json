CSE focuses on developing problem-solving methodologies and robust tools for numerical simulation. To understand phenomena and processes in science and engineering, we no longer have to rely solely on theories and experiments, but can also use computations. Numerical simulations can complement experiments and can even enable the study of systems and problems that would be too time-consuming, too expensive, or too dangerous (if possible at all) using experiments alone.\nThe high level of detail and realism of these simulations requires advanced skills in mathematical modeling, numerical analysis, efficient algorithms, computer architecture, software design and implementation, as well as validation and visualization of results. This program equips engineering, science, or mathematics graduates with the skills needed for a successful professional or academic career in CSE.\nFor more details:\n- The talk on \"Computational Science Education at the Technical University of Munich\" by the CSE program director Prof. Hans-Joachim Bungartz (from 2016) provides a broader perspective on the CSE study program.\n- The TED talk about Computational Science and Engineering by Karen Willcox (from 2022) provides a more up-to-date view.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nKey Data\nKey Data\nType of Study: Full-time\nStandard Duration of Studies: 4 Semesters\nCredits: 120 ECTS\nMain Locations: Garching\nStart of Degree Program: Winter Semester\nLanguage of Instruction: English\nCosts: semester fee, no tuition fees\nProfessional Profile: Informatics\nKey Data\n----------------------------------------\n\nHow is the program structured?\nHow is the program structured?\nThe Master’s program in Computational Science and Engineering is a multidisciplinary program where the first three semesters focus on lectures, tutorials, and seminars, and the fourth semester is reserved for the Master's thesis.\nThe program covers a wide range of subjects and research areas, including numerical analysis, computer science, scientific computing and various applications such as computational physics, computational fluid dynamics, visualization, and many more. To ensure a broad range of topics as well as excellent expertise in each area, the CSE program is offered in cooperation with several TUM departments across three TUM schools (CIT, NAT, and ED).\nAll mandatory modules of the program are taught in English, but some modules within the application areas may be offered bilingually (German lectures and English course material, or vice versa) or be conducted in German, which would allow a broader choice of application areas.\nHow is the program structured?\n----------------------------------------\n\nWhat further expertise and skills will I acquire?\nWhat further expertise and skills will I acquire?\nWith the degree in M.Sc. in Computational Science and Engineering, you will have a comprehensive portfolio of skills in computer science, numerical analysis, scientific computing, and their relevant applications, methods, and techniques.\nThe Computer Science curriculum includes the core subjects Advanced Programming and Parallel Programming, as well as a choice between Computer Architecture and Networks, Basic Algorithms, Scientific Visualization, and Patterns in Software Engineering.\nIn Numerical Analysis, the focus is on Numerical Programming and Numerical Algorithms for High Performance Computing.\nIn addition, you will have acquired both theoretical and practical skills in scientific computing and will be able to apply your theoretical knowledge to current research questions in your individual area of focus.\nWhat further expertise and skills will I acquire?\n----------------------------------------\n\nWhat career opportunities do I have afterwards?\nWhat career opportunities do I have afterwards?\nGraduates of the Master's program in Computational Science and Engineering can look forward to inspiring careers in this important and dynamic field.

If you are interested in computer science or computer engineering, the Informatics Master's program is for you. The same is true if your primary interest is Robotics or Machine Learning, as these other programs would likely be a better fit for you.\nIf you have a degree in a computer-related or mathematical discipline, you will need to demonstrate sufficient expertise in an engineering or science subject. This can be accomplished, for example, by completing an appropriate minor.\nIn addition, you will have to demonstrate the following skills\n- A solid understanding of mathematics at an advanced level (see \"Solid basic knowledge of mathematics\" below).\n- Knowledge of a modern programming language, e.g. C++, Java, Python, Fortran (see \"Solid basic programming skills\" below)\n- Very good English language skills (see here)\nThe aptitude test assessment the M.Sc. Computational Science and Engineering is a two-stage process in which we assess your qualifications with regard to the special qualitative requirements of this Master's program. Depending on the results of the first stage, you may be accepted directly, rejected directly, or invited to a telephone interview for the second stage of the selection process.\nApplication and Admission\n----------------------------------------\n\nApplication Periods\nApplication Periods\nWinter semester: 1 February – 31 May 2024\nNote: International applicants are advised to apply early (e.g. by 31 March 2023) to avoid delays in visa procedures and other formal processes. You can still apply by the usual deadline, but risk missing introductory events (if further steps take longer).\nApplication Periods\n----------------------------------------\n\nHow do I apply?\nHow do I apply?\nYou have to apply for the Master's degree via TUMonline. After you have created your account in TUMonline, please enter the requested personal data and information about your education, and upload the required documents. The application is completely electronic.\nProspective students with a Bachelor's degree from outside the European Union have to request a preliminary examination documentation from uni-assist (VPD) in advance.\nOnly in case of admission you will have to submit some additional documents as certified copies for enrollment.\nApplication for a Master's program - step by step\nGeneral application information portal\nHow do I apply?\n----------------------------------------\n\nWhich documents do I need to submit with my application?\nWhich documents do I need to submit with my application?\nDisclaimer: The application process has been updated for the 2024/2025 winter semester.

Informatics)\n- Applied mathematics\n- an equivalent subject\nIf you have a degree in a computer-related or mathematical discipline, you must demonstrate sufficient knowledge in an engineering or science subject. This can be done, for example, by taking the appropriate subject as a minor.\nIn addition, you will need to prove you have the following skills:\n\nSolid basic knowledge in mathematics\nQualification Requirements and Assessment Process > Solid basic knowledge in mathematics\nSolid basic knowledge in mathematics is indispensable for participation in the CSE Master's program. You should be able to demonstrate good knowledge in the topics taught in the mathematics courses of a German Bachelor in Engineering, i.e. linear algebra and integral and vector calculus, in the best case also numerics and stochastics.\n\nSolid basic programming skills\nQualification Requirements and Assessment Process > Solid basic programming skills\nBesides the solid basic knowledge in mathematics, skills in a modern (object-oriented) programming language (e.g., C++, Java, Python, Fortran, Julia, Rust, etc.) are needed. These need to be demonstrated by courses taken as part of your previous degree program(s). You may also point out respective experience in your CV or via additional certificates.\n\nSolid fundamentals and subject-specific knowledge in engineering and/or natural sciences\nQualification Requirements and Assessment Process > Solid fundamentals and subject-specific knowledge in engineering and/or natural sciences\nDepending on your specific course of study, you should also have solid skills in engineering fundamentals (technical mechanics, materials science, circuit theory, etc.) and/or natural sciences (physics, chemistry, biophysics, etc.), typically within the first 4-5 semesters of your studies, as well as advanced knowledge in the specific area of specialization corresponding to your course of study (generally, courses from the latter semesters). This could, for instance, comprise: thermodynamics, heat/mass transfer, mechanical processes, hydro-mechanics, thermal processes, reaction engineering, power engineering, control systems, communications engineering, sensor technology, theoretical physics, nuclear physics, quantum physics, statistical mechanics, biotechnology, organic chemistry, etc.\nPlease have a look at the bachelor programs at TUM and the corresponding number of ECTS in mathematical, programming, fundamentals and course-specific subjects:\n- Mechanical Engineering\n- Civil Engineering\n- Electrical and Computer Engineering\n- Physics\n- Biochemistry\nIf you graduated from a different program, please compare with the program which is closest to your program in terms of competences. As a rule of thumb, you should roughly have at least 25 ECTS in mathematics, 10 ECTS in programming, 50 ECTS in fundamentals, and 30 ECTS in your specialization. In any case, make sure to list all relevant courses in the curricular analysis document!\n\nAssessment Process\nAssessment Process\nThe assessment process for CSE is described in detail in the program-specific Academic and Examination Regulations (FPSO). A brief summary of this process is provided here for convenience.\nAssessment runs in two stages:\nStage 1: We assess your application documents based on the following criteria:\n- Academic background and relevant competencies (max. 40 points) (*):Solid basic knowledge in mathematics (10 points)Solid basic programming skills (10 points)Solid fundamentals and subject-specific knowledge in engineering and/or natural sciencesFundamentals (10 points)Subject-specific knowledge (10 points)\n- Solid basic knowledge in mathematics (10 points)\n- Solid basic programming skills (10 points)\n- Solid fundamentals and subject-specific knowledge in engineering and/or natural sciencesFundamentals (10 points)Subject-specific knowledge (10 points)\n- Fundamentals (10 points)\n- Subject-specific knowledge (10 points)\n- Grade Point Average (max. 15 points) (*)\n- Motivational Letter (plus CV and additional documents) (max. 25 points)\n≥55 points → Admission (✓)40–54 points → Proceed to Stage 2<40 points → Rejection (✗)\nStage 2: You'll be invited to an admission interview where we will ask about your motivation, background, previous experience, etc. (max. 45 points)\nThe scores from (*) and stage 2 are then added together:\n≥60 points → Admission (✓)<60 points → Rejection (✗)\nQualification Requirements and Assessment Process\n----------------------------------------\n\nTimetable and Deadlines\nTimetable and Deadlines\nOnline application and submission of required documents For the winter semester:  February 1 – March 31, 2024: recommended application deadline for applicants who need a visa  February 1 – May 31, 2024: compulsory application deadline\nNo submission of missing application documents after the official application deadline will be accepted!\nTime frame for interviews: April – September\nStart of program (lecture period) Winter semester: October 2024\nCheck here for exact dates.\nTimetable and Deadlines\n----------------------------------------\n\nDuring your Studies\nDuring your Studies\nAll important information for the start of the program will be covered in the Informatics-wide orientation program.\nFor the successful completion of the Master's program in Computational Science and Engineering, 120 credits are required:\n- Lectures, exercises, and practical courses from required and elective modules (90 Credits)\n- Master's Thesis (30 Credits)\nDetailed information can be found below. For more information, see Degree Program Contents.\nDuring your Studies\n----------------------------------------\n\nRequired Modules\nRequired Modules\n- Computer Science, required (Section A): 10 Credits\n- Scientific Computing (Section C): 31 Credits \tThis includes a seminar (5 ECTS) and a practical course (10 ECTS) which can be chosen according to your interests.\nList of required modules\nRequired Modules\n----------------------------------------\n\nElective Modules\nElective Modules\nTo complete the CSE program, you must attend 49 ECTS of elective courses. The area of elective modules is split into 4 parts:\n- Computer science – electives (section A)\n- Applied mathematics (section B)\n- Application areas of CSE (section D). This section is further split into 6 different catalogs\n- Other electives (section E)\nA minimum number of ECTS must be obtained from each of the first three sections: 10 for Computer Science, 16 for Applied Mathematics, and 8 from a single catalog in section D. The remaining (up to 15) ECTS can be covered by elective modules from any section or catalog.\nThus, the above can be summarized as follows:\nYou must earn a total of at least 49 ECTS from elective modules, subject to the following rules.\n- You must earn at least 10 ECTS from the section A electives.\n- You must earn at least 16 ECTS from the section B electives.\n- You must earn at least 8 ECTS from one D catalog.\n- Remaining ECTS (up to 15) can be earned from any section or catalog.\nOverview of the elective modules\nElective Modules\n----------------------------------------\n\nAdvanced Practical Course CSE\nAdvanced Practical Course CSE\nThe advanced practical course (lab) is a mandatory module in which CSE students choose a practical lab course with a topic suitable for CSE. Students then usually work in groups on a larger project. Such a lab course has 10 ECTS and provides a large amount of practical and social skills.\nRegistration for practical courses typically follows the matching process. Read more about this under \"Course registration\".\nAdvanced Practical Course CSE\n----------------------------------------\n\nCSE Seminar Scientific Computing\nCSE Seminar Scientific Computing\nThe Seminar Scientific Computing is a special type of module, different from usual lectures or lab courses: It involves studying a selected topic with the individual guide of a TUM researcher. Students are then usually asked to write a scientific report and give a talk for the rest of the seminar participants. The grade is often determined by both the report and the talk.\nRegistration for seminar courses typically follows the matching process. Read more about this under \"Course registration\"\nCSE Seminar Scientific Computing\n----------------------------------------\n\nCourse & Exam Registration\nCourse & Exam Registration\nRegistration for courses is usually done via TUMOnline. There you can look up lectures, tutor/exercise groups and exams – and register. Information about TUMOnline can be found here. Please note that registering for a lecture does not automatically mean registering for the corresponding tutor group, exercise group or exam. The same applies to retakes of exams: Each process is completely independent of the others. This means that you have to register separately in order to participate in the tutor group or the exam. Especially for exam registration, a late registration is not possible!\nPlease note that the registration modalities for certain courses might be slightly different: Seminars and lab courses, for example, may require participation in the matching process. In addition, a mandatory kickoff session is often offered. This usually takes place at the end of the semester prior to the semester in which the course is offered. This means that if you plan to attend a seminar in the summer 24 or winter 24/25 semester, you should find out how to register for the seminar and plan your studies one month before the end of the class period of the winter 23/24 or summer semester 24 respectively. If you miss the kickoff session, it may no longer be possible to register for the course or you may already be missing important information. In any case, please contact the course organizer directly instead of us, since we play no role in the matching process.\nCourse & Exam Registration\n----------------------------------------\n\nCSE-specific Processes\nCSE-specific Processes\nCSE-specific Processes\n----------------------------------------\n\nHonors Program\nHonors Program\nThe Bavarian Graduate School of Computational Engineering (BGCE) is an association of three master’s programs:\n- Computational Science and Engineering (CSE, i.e., this program; taught at TUM)\n- Computational Mechanics (COME, taught at TUM)\n- Computational Engineering (CE) (at University Erlangen-Nuremberg)\nThe BGCE Honors Track, an elite program within the Bavarian Elite Network, offers additional courses to the most capable and dedicated students in each of the partner's degree programs. The Honors Track program aims to enhance both the academic training and personal skills of the selected students.

Recognition is regulated by APSO §16. There are three types of recognition:\n- Recognition of examinations taken at a higher education institution abroad, e.g. from your previous studies.\n- Recognition of examinations taken during a stay abroad during your CSE studies.\n- Consecutive recognition of examinations taken during a Bachelor's or Master's program at TUM.\nThe following information holds true for the first type of recognition. If you want to transfer examination results according to point two or three, please see below.\n\nRegulations for recognition (from previous studies)\nRegulations for recognition (from previous studies)\nIt is only possible to apply for a recognition during the first year of your CSE studies.\n\nDocuments for recognition\nRegulations for recognition (from previous studies) > Documents for recognition\nTo obtain a recognition, you should submit the following four documents:\n- The application form for recognition. Please complete it and sign it.\n- Detailed descriptions for the content of each examination from your previous degree program (ideally, an official course syllabus).\n- A Transcript of Records verifying that you have successfully taken the exam and listing the grade you received in the exam.\n- A grading table specifying the maximum possible grade and the minimum passing grade for the course. This will be used to transfer your grade into the German grading system.\nIn the application form, please specify which CSE modules you would like to get recognized. You should also indicate which previous examination results you would like to be considered. It is possible to combine several previous examinations to fulfill the requirements of one CSE module. It is also possible to apply for more than just one module recognition. Please submit a form for each CSE module you wish to obtain recognition for.\nThe most important documents are the descriptions of the examinations from your previous studies. These should be as detailed possible to ensure that the contents of the examinations (lecture, exercise, seminar, practical course, etc.) cover all the contents of the CSE module. If your former university does not provide such a document, you will have to write the description yourself. You should sign the document to confirm that the description is accurate. The more detailed the description is, the greater the chances that it will be approved.\nTo prove that you actually passed the examination you want to get recognized for CSE, you must provide a transcript of records that includes the title of the exam, the scope of the course (amount of credits and/or duration) and the grade you received in the exam. The transcript must be either the original or a certified copy.\nTo transfer your previous grade into the German grading system, we need a grading table. This grading table must provide at least the following information: best possible grade, worst possible grade, and minimum grade to pass the examination.\n\nProcess of Recognition\nRegulations for recognition (from previous studies) > Process of Recognition\n- Fill out the application form completely. Provide all required documents listed above and submit them to the CSE coordinators.

Once you have accepted the recognition, you cannot retake the TUM module exam to improve the transferred grade.\n\nRegulations for recognition (from a stay abroad)\nRegulations for recognition (from a stay abroad)\nThe recognition should be discussed individually with the CSE coordinators before the planned stay. Otherwise, chances are that the modules taken might not be recognized for the CSE.\n\nRegulations for recognition (from another study at TUM)\nRegulations for recognition (from another study at TUM)\nFree/additional courses (not used in the previous study's curriculum) or mandatory CSE modules (which have already been passed) can be transferred 1:1, meaning that you transfer a module from the former study program at TUM into the same module from the CSE program. In this case, please only fill out the application form for recognition.\nRecognitions\n----------------------------------------\n\nThesis\nThesis\nPlease be aware that CSE has its own examination board and, as such, some regulations differ from other Informatics' Programs. Most importantly, registration, submission, and (when applicable) extensions are processed via the CSE Coordinators and NOT via the Servicebüro Studium (SB-S-IN).\nThe master's thesis should preferably be started after all other program courses have been completed, but this is not a must. However, if the number of missing credits is too high, registration can and will be declined. As a policy, a person at TUM always defines the topic officially, but you can conduct your thesis in a variety of settings and get advice from people outside TUM:\n- Under the supervision of a TUM chairThis is the most common choice for CSE students. Visit the website where TUM thesis offers are published to have a first idea of what topics exist. However, not all thesis offers are posted on this website, and not all offers on the page apply to CSE! Another option is to visit the websites of the research groups that interest you (or the lecturers/tutors of your courses) and contact them directly: It never hurts to ask!\n- At another university or research instituteVisit the university's or institute's website to search for a topic of interest.\n- At a companyMany of our students start their thesis at a company where they have worked as an intern or a Werkstudent, for example.\nIn the last two cases, you will have to make sure that you still find an examiner at TUM from one of the CSE-related schools (formerly, one of the 7 related departments):\n- TUM School of Computation, Information, and Technology (CIT): comprising the former departments of Informatics (IN), Mathematics (MA), and Electrical and Computer Engineering (EI)\n- TUM School of Engineering and Design (ED): comprising the former departments of Mechanical Engineering (MW), and Civil, Geo and Environmental Engineering (BGU), and\n- TUM School of Natural Sciences (NAT): comprising the former departments of Physics (PH) and Chemistry (CH).\nThey will process your registration form and grade your thesis. In such a setting, often an external person acts as an assistant advisor/supervisor.\nThe CSE program coordinators often receive thesis offers from institutes at universities, various companies, or former CSE students. External offers for theses are usually sent by email, and/or posted at the bulletin board in front of the chair.\nEach thesis must be examined by one (or two) professor(s) (with “Prof.” or “PD” in their title), at least one of whom must be a faculty member at TUM. If you wish to complete your thesis at an external company, please make sure to find suitable examiners in time. Past students have experienced that it can be difficult to find professors willing to act as examiners for the master's thesis if they did not propose the topic.\nThe master's thesis should be written in English. The Examination Board may accept another language (specifically, German), but a summary in English must be included in that case. The summary should not exceed one page (15–20 lines are sufficient).\nNeed help writing in English? The English Writing Center offers free one-on-one English writing consultation to all members of the TUM community. This is a great offer that can improve the quality of your final thesis. Take a look at their website and feel free to book an appointment!\nFor a general overview of all formalities regarding the master's thesis, refer to this information. In particular, note that you must be enrolled throughout the working time of the thesis, up to the moment you submit (see thesis).\nThe aforementioned portal also includes a collection of tips and tricks regarding theses.\n\nThesis Registration\nThesis > Thesis Registration\nThesis registration defines the topic and the intended start date, and should be submitted as soon as the topic and schedule are decided: This helps narrow the content of the project and sets a deadline for submission. We highly recommend that you submit an abstract of the thesis before officially registratering for a topic, in order to ensure that the topic is appropriate for CSE. This is especially important if the thesis will be written at an external university, a company, or a non-CSE chair at TUM. Only topics that are related to CSE will be accepted!\nAs of the 15th of January 2024, theses are handled via the Koinon-School Portal to unify and digitize processes at the School of CIT, as well as ensuring that all involved parties are properly informed of any updates in the status of the thesis from registration through submission and final grading. If you've started your thesis before this date, you're still subject to the previous rules regarding submission (i.e., submission in physical form).\nFor consistency, we use the terms Supervisor (Betreuer in German) -- sometimes formerly referred to as advisor, and Examiner (Prüfer in German), corresponding to the evaluating Prof. or PD -- sometimes formerly referred to as supervisor.\nTo register for your master's thesis, your supervisor will need to enter your registration on the portal up to two weeks before the official starting date at the earliest. You will then be informed via email about the entry, which you have to confirm is correct. This includes theses examined by professors in other departments. If there are issues with this workflow, please contact us and send your thesis proposal to the Examination Board (via email or in person to the secretary of the CSE examination board) using this registration form. (If you have two TUM examiners, please use this form instead.)\n\nSubmitting your Master's Thesis\nThesis > Submitting your Master's Thesis\n\nSubmission Deadline\nThesis > Submitting your Master's Thesis > Submission Deadline\nThe master's thesis must be submitted no later than six months after the start date. The start date is indicated on the registration form.\nNote: Please make sure in advance that the chosen topic can be handled within the required timeframe. This is especially important if you plan to write your thesis at another university or an external institution, as they may be used to having more time to complete a thesis project.\n\nSubmission Requirements\nThesis > Submitting your Master's Thesis > Submission Requirements\nThe use of a proper typesetting system like LaTeX is strongly recommended. Please refer to the thesis guidelines and rules for form and delivery while you are working on the thesis. Since these thesis guidelines hold for theses of the Depts. of CS and CE programs, make sure you adapt them for CSE. Most importantly, ensure that all relevant information appears in the title pages, and make sure to include the signed Declaration of Own Work.\nAn unofficial template that fulfills all formal requirements for CSE can be found here (provided by Walter Simson). Feel free to use templates from other departments (particularly if writing a thesis with them), but make sure to adopt changes to conform to the CSE requirements!\nSubmission will now take place digitally via the Koinon-Portal. For theses which were not registered on the portal (i.e., started before Jan. 15, 2024), the following regulations still apply:\nYou must submit identical copies of your thesis:\n- one official copy for the Examination Board (printed hard-copy)\n- one copy for each of your examiners (can be digital if your examiner allows it)\nThe official copy for the Examination Board must be submitted to the CSE coordinators (in person or to our mailbox). You may give the additional copies directly to the examiner(s) or submit the copies via the coordinators, who will forward them to the examiner(s) for grading. Again, please make sure to include the Declaration of Own Work is signed.\nIf an in-person submission is not possible, you may also submit the thesis via postal services. In such a case, the postmark date (i.e., date on the stamp) will be the submission date. Please send your documents to the following address:CSE CoordinatorsChair of Scientific Computing - Informatics 5School of Computation, Information and TechnologyBoltzmannstr. 385748 Garching\nPlease note: All copies must be submitted by the submission deadline.\n\nThesis Grading\nThesis > Submitting your Master's Thesis > Thesis Grading\nAfter you submit your thesis, the coordinators will send a request for grading to the examiners. The examiners usually need a few weeks for reviewing and grading. When having more than one examiner, the thesis grade is calculated by averaging the value of the two grades given by the examiners.\n\nThesis Presentation\nThesis > Submitting your Master's Thesis > Thesis Presentation\nCSE regulations do not require thesis presentations, but some examiners choose to make them mandatory. If your examiner requires you to present your thesis, he/she will determine the presentation format, and you will be responsible for finding a date and room for the presentation. You are welcome to use the SCCS Colloquium for this purpose.\nPlease note: The submission date of your thesis is the official last date of your thesis work. Even if your presentation takes place after this date, the submission date will still be used for official purposes.\n\nExtension of deadline\nThesis > Submitting your Master's Thesis > Extension of deadline\nIf you are unable to meet the submission deadline for any reason outside your control (i.e. access to resources/facilities, software/hardware failure, medical conditions, ...), you can request an extension on the Koinon-Portal as well. If you started your thesis before the transition, please send your extension request via the secretary of the Examination Board (per email or in person) with appropriate documentation supporting your argument. Your examiner must agree to the extension (by signing the request or, better yet, issuing a statement acknowledging the reasons for the extension).\nPlease note that requesting additional time to improve results or polishing the work is not a valid reason for extension!\nIn general, if you are ill and prevented from working on the thesis, the working period will be paused according to the received medical certification. Please refer to the following link describing what the medical note must include in order to be considered valid.\nWe do not have a specific format for the extension (a free-form letter is valid), but allow usage of the forms for other programs/departments. However, in this case, make sure that the request is properly addressed to us and not the other department!\nPlease send any extension request as soon as issues arise, and at least one week before the deadline, so that the extension can be processed in a timely manner. In addition, you should check well in advance of the submission deadline, whether any circumstances that demand an extension have occurred.\nThesis\n----------------------------------------\n\nGraduation\nGraduation\nAfter successfully completing the course requirements and master’s thesis, you will graduate with a Master of Science (M.Sc.) degree and begin your professional life.
