Regardless of the specific challenges posed to this set of students, whose lives at university are affected to a greater or lesser extent, their individual requirements must be taken into consideration to establish suitable conditions of study.\nInformation for students with disabilities or chronic illnesses\n----------------------------------------\n\nInformation for Students\nInformation for students with disabilities or chronic illnesses > Information for Students\nInformation for Students\n----------------------------------------\n\nPoints of Contact\nInformation for students with disabilities or chronic illnesses > Points of Contact\n- For students of TUM Informatics, Imme Proske is responsible for handling all academic affairs concerning students with disabilities and chronic illnesses.  To compensate for any disadvantages during the course of your studies in Informatics, appropriate and specific measures are discussed in a private consultation. A request for Compensating for disadvantages in studies (in German: Nachteilsausgleich, see below) could be a solution.The TUM Department of Informatics is highly committed to eliminating any disadvantages due to disability and illness.\n- TUM also administers a university-wide service office for disabled and chronically ill students and prospective students Inclusion at TUM\nGeneral information provided by the German Student Union (only available in German):\n- Studying with disabilities\n- BEST - survey on studying with disabilities\nPoints of Contact\n----------------------------------------\n\nCompensating for Disadvantages in Studies\nInformation for students with disabilities or chronic illnesses > Compensating for Disadvantages in Studies\nStudents with long-term or permanent disabilities or health impairments or chronic illnesses often find it difficult to cope with the required workload of a semester. Impairments can lead to the fact that certain exam performances cannot be taken under the required conditions. In many cases, impairments are compensable.\nPlease contact the representative for chronically ill and disabled students (see right sidebar or mobile further below) in good time at the beginning of your first semester with regard to compensation for disadvantages. She will advise you in detail about the procedure of applicating for compensation for disadvantages.\nTo do this, submit either the application form for disadvantage compensation or an informal application to the representative for chronically ill and disabled students. It is important that your application is supported by a current detailed original medical report/attest and, if applicable, by a copy of your severely disabled ID.\nAfter successful processing of the application, you will receive a letter of approval in which only the type of compensation for disadvantages, but not the medical background, is recorded. With this letter, the applicant informs the respective lecturer about the type of measure granted, at the latest when registering for the exami, by presenting this letter.\nThe granting of a disadvantage compensation is not mentioned in final degree document!\nImportant! Please become active in time! The application for disadvantage compensation should definitely be received by the examination board within the 6 weeks of your first semester. Since the examination process takes a few weeks, this is the only way to ensure that you will receive the decision before your first examination registration.\nCompensating for Disadvantages in Studies\n----------------------------------------\n\nFunding opportunities: Barrier-Free from bachelor’s to doctorate\nInformation for students with disabilities or chronic illnesses > Funding opportunities: Barrier-Free from bachelor’s to doctorate\nThis information is currently only available in German.

Particularly disabilities that are not readily visible, such as internal diseases or hearing impairments, can easily be overlooked. Students without visible disabilities are not always able to follow the standard course of study as easily as their non-disabled fellow students. A survey (only available in German) was conducted in the year 2012 on the situation of students with disabilities and chronic illnesses: BEST - survey on studying with disabilities. The survey reflects experiences students had at German institutions of higher education and universities.\nIt is important to signal to disabled and chronically ill students that, aside from their legal rights, there is a willingness on the part of the institution to compensate any disadvantages resulting from a disability and to encourage these students to communicate their disability in a confidential meeting with the Departmental Contact for Disabled and Chronically Ill Students.\nAs a rule, students who are granted reasonable accommodation will approach you in the first lecture week of the semester and present a letter confirming their approval issued by the Examination Board, in order to implement the appropriate measures with your support. A typical request for reasonable accommodation might be, for instance, an extension of the specified time for written exams. Should you have any questions regarding the organizational implementation of reasonable accommodations, please contact the Departmental Contact for Disabled and Chronically Ill Students at any time.\nThe following booklet (only available in German) provides information and references on specific situations of students with disabilities or chronic illnesses: References for university teaching staff.\nPlease feel free to contact the Departmental Contact for Disabled and Chronically Ill Students for advice or support.\nInformation for University Teaching Staff\n----------------------------------------\n\n",
