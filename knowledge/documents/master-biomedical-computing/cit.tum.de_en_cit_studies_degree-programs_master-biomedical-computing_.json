Remaining credits are filled with complementary courses that depend on the students' previous education. Computer science majors can choose from an advanced course in mathematics, whereas mathematics and physics majors can select from a set of computer science courses.\nIn semesters 2 and 3, students attend additional mandatory courses related to medicine and visual computing and acquire practical experience by participating in practical courses and the clinical project. Students usually finish their coursework at the end of the third semester.\nSemester 4 is reserved for the Master's thesis. The program offers you the possibility of working on your thesis at one of the partner universities of TUM if you are interested in a particular topic. Completing your master thesis at an external company or research institute is also possible. In those cases, at least one professor of TUM has to act as an examiner of the thesis.\nHow is the program structured?\n----------------------------------------\n\nApplication\nBiomedical Computing > Application\nThe degree program Master's of Biomedical Computing is being discontinued.
