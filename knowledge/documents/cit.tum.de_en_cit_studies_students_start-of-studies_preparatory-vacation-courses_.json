They help you get started at the university and give you the opportunity to get to know future fellow students in advance and to find your way around the TUM Campus. Enrolled students also have the opportunity to prepare for the next semester – with the introductory seminar L&L, in-depth vacation courses or the vacation seminar of the Hurwitz Society\nPreparatory and Vacation Courses Mathematics\n----------------------------------------\n\nPrecourses for first-year students\nPreparatory and Vacation Courses Mathematics > Precourses for first-year students\nTUM offers first-year students preliminary courses for various fields of study such as mathematics, physics, informatics, electrical engineering and information technology, engineering, aerospace and management. The courses are a perfect introduction to successful studies and therefore highly recommended by th CIT.\nThe precourses are not compulsory and not a prerequisite. The lectures of your study program are based on the general Abitur knowledge.\nPlease find all information on the respective course page (courses held in German have German titles):\n- Precourse Mathematics for Electrical Engineering (in German)\n- Precourse Mathematics for Informatics (in German and English)(Study programs B.Sc. Informatics, Informatics: Games Engineering, Information Systems, Bioinformatics)\n- Precourse Mathematics for Management & Technology, Aerospace, Science & Engineering, Geodesy & Geoinformation (in English)(Study programs B.Sc. Management & Technology, Aerospace, Science & Engineering, Geodesy & Geoinformation)\n- Precourse in Advanced Mathematics for Mechanical Engineering, Engineering Sciences, Geodesy (in German)(Study programs B.Sc. Mechanical Engineering, Engineering Science, Chemical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Environmental Engineering, Geodesy)\n- Precourse Mathematics for Mathematics and Physics (in German)\nPrecourses for first-year students\n----------------------------------------\n\nL&L – getting started with your studies\nPreparatory and Vacation Courses Mathematics > L&L – getting started with your studies\nThe course Lehr- und Lernformen (L&L – Teaching & Learning) is conceived for all first-year students of mathematics and takes place within the Study Introductory Days (SET: Studieneinführungstage). During the SET Days, you will get to know the TUM and the Garching campus and make first contacts with fellow students. The practice lecture, exercise classes and group work within L&L will make it easier for you to start your studies at the CIT.\nPlease find all current information at Lehr- und Lernformen (L&L – Teaching & Learning).\nL&L – getting started with your studies\n----------------------------------------\n\nVacation courses\nPreparatory and Vacation Courses Mathematics > Vacation courses\nDeepen your knowledge, repeat tricky topics and have your questions answered - vacation courses are ideal for those who want to prepare themselves for exams or need an introduction to software for mathematicians. The courses are a supplementary offer of our department, financed via study subsidies.\nYou are not required to attend. Also, we do not provide you any new teaching material you need to pass your exam. There are a number of one-day or several-day vacation courses on offer. Further information and the program can be found under vacation courses.\nVacation courses\n----------------------------------------\n\nOne-day courses\nPreparatory and Vacation Courses Mathematics > One-day courses\nFor some major Bachelor lectures, such as Analysis and Linear Algebra, there are one-day refresher courses shortly before the respective exam during the semester break.\nOne-day courses\n----------------------------------------\n\nSeveral-day courses\nPreparatory and Vacation Courses Mathematics > Several-day courses\nDepending on the demand, we offer two to four-day courses for some lectures, such as Analysis and Linear Algebra, before the respective repeat exams.\nSeveral-day courses\n----------------------------------------\n\nComputer courses\nPreparatory and Vacation Courses Mathematics > Computer courses\nIn addition, we regularly hold introductory computer courses during the semester break, for example on LaTeX, on the implementation of optimization problems with PDEs or on linear optimization.\nComputer courses\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nVacation seminar of the Hurwitz Society\nPreparatory and Vacation Courses Mathematics > Vacation seminar of the Hurwitz Society\nA seminar in an informal atmosphere: Every year in fall, the Hurwitz Society for the promotion of mathematics at the TUM offers a vacation seminar for all students from the fourth semester on. It offers you the opportunity to listen to lectures, exchange professional ideas and get to know your lecturers better. The vacation seminar can be credited to your bachelor studies just like a regular seminar.\nFind out more about the alumni organization at Hurwitz Society.\nVacation seminar of the Hurwitz Society\n----------------------------------------\n\n",
