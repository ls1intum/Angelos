In this case please note that you will have to catch up independently or with the help of fellow students.\nThere are no online or hybrid classes and lectures usually are not recorded. The professors themselves decide whether to record their lectures. You can register for the courses via TUMonline and then ask the professors to send the material or to record their lectures.\nIn the worst case, a delay can lead to basic hurdles (see Student Guide page 19) not being reached and, without evidence of the delay due to a visa, this can lead to exmatriculation.\nYou then have the option of submitting a hardship application. You can request that you are granted one or two additional semesters to pass the basic exams. It is important that you can provide the relevant evidence regarding the late issuance of the visa. Please contact us as soon as you can foresee that your late arrival will result in a hardship application.\nWhat happens if I can not show up in time for lectures due to visa delays?\n----------------------------------------\n\nWho can advise where to find scholarship options?\nFrequently Asked Questions > Who can advise where to find scholarship options?\nPlease check this website in order to find out about scholarship options.\nWho can advise where to find scholarship options?\n----------------------------------------\n\nCan I talk to somebody in person or online?\nFrequently Asked Questions > Can I talk to somebody in person or online?\nIf you would like to meet us within a virtual meeting, we warmly recommend our Infosessions which take place regularly.
