Student Testimonials > Ketaki, from Kolhapur, India, B.Sc. Information Engineering student since Winter Semester 2022
Honestly studying at TUM has been so far one of the best decisions I ever made for my career. The course BIE is relatively new and I had my doubts about it just like other students. But it has turned out to be very well structured and up to date with the industrial standards. Studying at TUM is a challenge, but it has opened doors for a lot of new experiences and opportunities.

What I like the most about our campus in Heilbronn is that we all feel very comfortable there. When I go to the campus on the weekend I meet my friends studying in "breakout rooms", playing Billard, singing karaoke or heating up Lasagne in our kitchen.

Student Testimonials > Paulina, from Warsaw, Poland, B.Sc. Information Engineering student since Winter Semester 2022
I can say that studying here gave me a huge opportunity to broaden my horizons not only in the IT field by providing us with great professors and a well-designed curriculum but also enabled me to interact with students from different countries all over the world. What I appreciate the most and what sets TUM Campus Heilbronn apart from other campuses is that we study in smaller groups. The learning is more personalized, and as students, we are more integrated and can always count on each other's help.
