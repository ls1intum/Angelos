How can I find out if my chances for admission are good? Can I send my documents beforehand?
Frequently Asked Questions > How can I find out if my chances for admission are good? Can I send my documents beforehand?
If you would like to find out about your chances in the application process, you can evaluate your chances according to the following regulations of our admission process:
As part of the first stage of the admission process, we evaluate your high school diploma (e.g. Abitur) and your half-year grades for the last two years in Mathematics, English, and one Natural Science. You can achieve up to 100 points within our points-based system.
- The overall grade of the university entrance qualification accounts for 65%.
- The remaining 35% consists of the English grade, the math grade, which is worth three times, and the best natural science (or Informatics) of yours, which is worth two times. Depending on the amount of points accumulated, applicants are either immediately admitted or rejected, or they are invited to an interview carried out by the department faculty:If you score more than 73 points or more you get a direct admission.If you score less than 60 points, you will receive a rejection. You can apply again in for one of the future semesters.If you score between 61 and 72 points, you will be invited to an interview.
- If you score more than 73 points or more you get a direct admission.
- If you score less than 60 points, you will receive a rejection. You can apply again in for one of the future semesters.
- If you score between 61 and 72 points, you will be invited to an interview.
Please note: This is just a general information. There may be exceptions, even if you score more than 73 points. For example, if you are an international applicant and do not submit individual grades in relevant subjects, we will also invite you to an interview.
Please check our Student Guide on page18 and our Aptitude Assessment Statute for further information.
Your application will be checked by the TUM Center for Study and Teaching.
Please do not send any documents to the Student-Service-Center. We can not check any individual documents beforehand. Thank you for your understanding.

What happens if I can not show up in time for lectures due to visa delays?
Frequently Asked Questions > What happens if I can not show up in time for lectures due to visa delays?
Should you have received an admission, first of all, please let us know if we can support you with the visa by issuing a confirmation letter or asking for an expedited procedure at your visa office.
If you won`t be able to arrive in time due to visa delays, you can start your studies later. In this case please note that you will have to catch up independently or with the help of fellow students.
There are no online or hybrid classes and lectures usually are not recorded. The professors themselves decide whether to record their lectures. You can register for the courses via TUMonline and then ask the professors to send the material or to record their lectures.
In the worst case, a delay can lead to basic hurdles (see Student Guide page 19) not being reached and, without evidence of the delay due to a visa, this can lead to exmatriculation.
You then have the option of submitting a hardship application. You can request that you are granted one or two additional semesters to pass the basic exams. It is important that you can provide the relevant evidence regarding the late issuance of the visa. Please contact us as soon as you can foresee that your late arrival will result in a hardship application.
