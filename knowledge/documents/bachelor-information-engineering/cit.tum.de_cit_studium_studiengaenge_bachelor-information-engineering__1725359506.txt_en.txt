What do I need to consider if I come from abroad?
Applicants for a bachelor’s degree program with a foreign university entrance qualification require prior to the online application a preliminary check of their graduation certificates by uni-assist. Since this can take up to four weeks in total, we recommend that you initiate this process early.
International applicants must also submit one of the verifications of German language skills listed here, as some elective modules are taught in German. The verification must be received by TUM by the application deadline. With this verification, you will meet the minimum requirement for admission. In order to successfully obtain your degree, it may be necessary to further develop and expand your own language skills. Our Language Center can help you in this respect.
The TUM website contains comprehensive information for international applicants. In order to ensure a smooth start to your studies, we recommend that foreign applicants, who need to apply for a visa to commence their studies in Germany, submit their application at the start of the application period and apply for the VPD certificate from uni-assist at an early stage.

Stage 1: Review of your documents
Stage 1: Review of your documents
All applicants must undergo aptitude assessment. Based on the documents uploaded by you, we will make a pre-selection as to whether you are
- classified as suitable and directly admitted to the program,
- invited to a mandatory assessment interview with a professor (Step 2)
- or are directly rejected.
What counts?
- Average grade in the “Abitur” certificate or your university entrance qualification
- Subject-specific individual grades (mathematics, English and a natural science continued until the “Abitur”, including informatics)
- Where applicable, additional supplementary training and education (relevant vocational training; at least 4-week subject-relevant practical course; participation in TUM’s studiumMINT; successful participation in “Jugend forscht” or “Mathematik-Olympiade”)
The calculation formulas can be found below in the aptitude assessment regulations.

Recognition of achievements  from previous studies
Recognition of achievements  from previous studies
If you have received admission and if you have finished your enrollment, you have the possibility to apply for recognition of credits from previous studies which have been completed externally. This is possible if the knowledge and skills acquired match those of the B.Sc. Information Engineering modules and if there is no significant difference between the learning outcomes to be achieved.
If you decide to apply for recognition of credits, please note:
- You can only apply once within your first year.
- If you have registered for the exam for this module, you can no longer apply for the recognition of credits.
- In order to ensure that your application is complete, please follow these guidelines. Please use the application form and submit your complete application via email to the Student Service Center.
If you have any questions regarding the application for recognition of credits, please contact us via email or visit the consultation hour.
