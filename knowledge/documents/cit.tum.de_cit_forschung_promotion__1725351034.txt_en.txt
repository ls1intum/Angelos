If your preferred mentor doesn't hold a PhD degree yet, please attach an informal statement to your supervision agreement that proves their aptitude for independent scientific research. Mentors can be subsequently registered or replaced (see Appendix 1 Supervision Agreement).Mentors can be subsequently registered or replaced (see Appendix 1 Supervision Agreement).

Onboarding events
Doctorate > Onboarding events
As a doctoral candidate, your scientific project will be your focus, of course. In order to obtain a doctorate at TUM, however, you will be responsible for also completing a qualification program and fulfilling organizational tasks in your various roles as a GC-CIT and TUM-GS member, junior researcher and employee or scholarship holder. No one can do that for you. As coordinators of your Graduate Center, however, we will be able to prepare you so well that you will be optimally oriented at the start of your doctorate and your effort, in turn, minimized.
For this purpose, we offer online onboarding events at regular intervals. We strongly recommend that everyone participates in them. The best time for this is around the time you are entered on the doctoral candidacy list, but all doctoral candidates in need of "tutoring" are welcome.
Registration for the onboarding event is unnecessary; just follow the Zoom access link. It will be useful if you have your DocGS account and your Supervision Agreement handy for the event.

Submission
Doctorate > Submission
Submitting your dissertation at the School of Computation, Information and Technology (CIT) happens in two steps:
- electronic submission via DocGS: We recommend submitting the work electronically at least 3.5 weeks before the School Council meeting.
- submitting the documents at the Center for Study and Teaching - Office of Doctoral Affairs: at least 3 weeks before the School Council meeting (hard deadline, entry stamp counts!)
At the same time, the supervisor (not the doctoral candidate) must report the examination committee to the GC CIT via email to gc_admin(at)cit.tum.de at least 3 weeks before the School Council meeting (hard deadline). Entering the examiners on the title page of the electronically submitted dissertation does not count as reporting the examination committee.
The upcoming School Council meetings can be found here: https://www.cit.tum.de/en/cit/school/organization/governing/.
