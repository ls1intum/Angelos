Title: Materials strategies towards the chronic and multimodal neural interfaces
Abstract: Microelectrode array (MEA) devices, placed in the nervous system to record and modulate neuroactivity have demonstrated success in neuroscience research and neural prosthesis applications. Functionalizing the microelectrode sites on MEAs to enable neurochemical sensing and drug delivery adds additional dimensions of information exchange and presents tremendous potential for understanding neural circuits and treating neurological diseases. In this talk, I will introduce the methods by which we enable chemical sensing and delivery from MEAs. By incorporating nanocarbon into the conducting polymer electrode coating, we achieved direct detection of electroactive species such as dopamine and serotonin. By immobilizing enzymes or aptamers on nanostructured electrodes, we achieved multisite detection of glutamate, GABA, and cocaine. By incorporating nanocarriers into conducting polymer coating, we enabled on-demand drug delivery. We demonstrated in vivo multisite and multiple analyte detection or neurotransmitter delivery along with neural recording from our multimodal neural probes. To overcome the challenges in the chronic neural interface, we use quantitative histology, explant analysis, and 2-photon imaging to uncover the mechanism of sensing/recording performance degradation and reveal biofouling, inflammatory host response, as well as material degradations. We use several bioengineering strategies to minimize these failure modes.  First, materials and devices that mimic the mechanical properties of the neural tissue have been shown to significantly improve device-tissue integration. Secondly, biomimetic coatings and drug delivery have been applied to reduce biofouling, sensor degradation, and inflammatory responses. These approaches may be combined to achieve long-term and high-fidelity multimodal neural interfacing.

Title: Human Cognition in Human-Robot Interaction
Abstract: As modern technology advances, we are designing increasingly sophisticated tools to support and assist humans. However, it is crucial to not only focus on the technology, but also address the mechanisms of human cognition during the use of the technology. It is those mechanisms that will eventually determine whether the technology is efficacious and well accepted by users.
In my lab, we study the mechanisms of human cognition in interaction between humans and humanoid robots. With cognitive neuroscience methods, we seek to understand how attention operates during collaborative tasks with the robots, how the human users attune to the robot during joint action, whether they experience sense of agency when teleoperating the robot and sense of joint of agency when they are engaged in a shared task with the robot. In this talk, I will present results from my lab related to the above topics that have been obtained with the use of cognitive neuroscience methods (EEG and eye tracking) in human-humanoid interaction protocols. I will then discuss how these research questions (and respective findings) can be translated from human-humanoid interaction to Neuroengineering.

Title: Polymeric Nanocarriers for Personalized Genetic Medicine
Abstract: Biodegradable polymeric nanoparticles can be engineered for intracellular delivery and cellular engineering, leading to new paradigms for personalized genetic medicine. Libraries of biodegradable polymeric nanoparticles were constructed and screened for the safe and effective intracellular delivery of DNA, miRNA, siRNA, and proteins. Differential polymer structure was found to significantly increase transfection efficacy and enable long-term in vivo gene expression. Tuning biomaterial structure also enables cell-type specificity of nanoparticles in a range of cell types.  Applications will be shown for non-viral ocular gene therapy, cancer stem cell reprogramming, gene editing, and immunotherapy.  These safe and effective biodegradable nanoparticles are promising as enabling technology to treat diverse human diseases.

Title: Neural computations in the cerebellar cortex during control of a movement
Abstract: Damage to the cerebellum typically causes dysmetria, affecting endpoint accuracy. What is the cerebellum computing that is so important for stopping a movement? In the marmoset, we have been studying saccadic eye movements, using silicon probes to quantify both the information that the cerebellar cortex receives via mossy fibers and climbing fibers, and the output it produces via Purkinje cells (P-cells). Our results suggest that the input encodes two different kinds of information: the goal of the movement in sensory coordinates, and the ongoing commands in motor coordinates. The output, as computed by populations of P-cells, produces a burst that rises analogous to predicting the real-time displacement of the eyes, and then suddenly and synchronously is inhibited when the eyes need to decelerate and stop. Thus, we speculate that the cerebellar cortex is computing in real-time the sensory consequences of the motor commands until it reaches a bound, as set by the desired goal of the movement, at which point the P-cells synchronously disinhibit the nucleus, thus stopping the movement.
Bio: Reza Shadmehr was born in Tehran, Iran, and was fortunate to be allowed by his parents to immigrate to the United States when he was 14 years old. He was raised in Spokane, Washington by foster parents and attended Gonzaga University, earning a BS in Electrical Engineering. He was subsequently mentored in robotics at the University of Southern California by Michael Arbib, where he was an IBM Graduate Fellow, then was awarded a McDonnell-Pew Postdoctoral Fellowship to attend MIT, where he was mentored in computational neuroscience by Emilio Bizzi. After MIT, he joined the Johns Hopkins Biomedical Engineering Department, where he has remained his entire career. He has authored three books and is an elected Fellow of the AIMBE. His greatest accomplishment, however, has been mentoring students who have gone on to become good citizens and creative scientists.

Title: Brain-Computer Interfaces for Neurorehabilitation and Beyond
Prof. Surjo Soekadar is Einstein professor of clinical neurotechnology at the Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin since 2018. After studying medicine in Mainz, Heidelberg and Baltimore and graduating with a doctorate in clinical neuropsychology, he worked as a physician at the university of Tübingen. In Tübingen, he was the head of the Applied Neurotechnology Lab from 2011 until 2018. His work is funded by the European Research Council and Prof. Soekadar has received several awards including the International BCI Research Award and the BIOMAG and NARSAD Young Investigator Awards.
Prof. Soekadar’s research covers a large spectrum of neuroengineering. It ranges from assistive brain computer interfaces (BCIs) that enable quadriplegic patients to use their paralyzed extremities to the application of closed-loop brain stimulation in psychiatry. In their goal to treat neurological and psychiatric disorders, the clinical neurotechnology lab also explores the future of BCIs, like optically pumped magnetometers and quantum sensing. Prof. Soekadar’s talk will be an interesting mixture of the aforementioned topics including the ethical concerns surrounding the clinical approaches.

The talk is hosted by Prof. Anton Sirota.
Abstract: In the past decade, there has been considerable interest in the development of Brain Computer Interface devices for basic research as well as for the diagnosis and treatment of numerous diseases. Since a key readout of brain function and dysfunction is an electrical activity, recording these signals is instrumental for many of these devices. Conducting polymers (CPs) have demonstrated the unique ability to conduct ions in addition to electronic charge carriers. Their integration allows for a more intimate coupling at the interface between the traditional microelectronics and biological tissue, which relies primarily on ion-based signaling. The “soft” nature of CPs results in better mechanical compatibility with biological environments than inorganic electronic materials, and allows for their simple processing onto a variety of flexible substrates often used in biomedical implants. These properties are essential for developing new tools for neuroscience, as current technology relies on highly invasive, penetrating probes that induce neural tissue damage and degrade signal quality. During this talk, I will review our latest advances in applying highly conformal CP-based devices to record electrophysiological signals from the brain. I will introduce the different examples of my recent work, covering the development of novel devices for neural interfacing in deep and surface EEG, and the fundamental understanding of conducting materials processing and signal recording rational.

Title: Investigating the neural basis of magnetoreception in the pigeon
Abstract:
The remarkable ability of animals to navigate over long distances is at least in part mediated by sensing the Earth’s magnetic field. Behavioral experiments on a large number of taxonomically diverse species support the existence of magnetoreceptive systems, however, the underlying sensorineural structures remain elusive. In the Keays lab we investigate where and how a magnetic stimulus is transduced into a neuronal impulse and how this information is integrated in the central nervous system of pigeons. Employing neuronal activity mapping, whole brain clearing and light sheet microscopy we show that exposing pigeons to rotating magnetic fields leads to increased activity in the brainstem vestibular nuclei, the dorsal thalamus and regions of the mesopallium and hippocampus of pigeons. These experiments provide evidence for a magnetosensory neuronal pathway originating in the pigeon vestibular system. Physical calculations, modeling and molecular ablation studies further support the hypothesis that magnetic fields might be detected by voltage sensitive ion channels in the vestibular system through a process called electromagnetic induction.

2nd MSNE Project Week (October 12-14, 2022)
2nd MSNE Project Week (October 12-14, 2022)
The second "MSNE Project Week" is an in-person scientific event being curated by a group of MSNE students, for MSNE students and faculty members. This week is planned to be a combination of talks, workshops, discussions, lab tours and social events to encourage the onboarding of our new batch of MSNE students. One goal is to bring together bright minds to give talks that are idea-focused and on a wide range of subjects to foster learning, inspiration, and wonder. In addition, we aim to provoke conversations that matter in the field of Neuroengineering. On top of that, visiting and seeing the labs where actual research is happening will considerably contribute to our mission. This will also profoundly connect MSNE students with the topics of Neuroengineering.

MSNE Project Week (18-22 October, 2021)
MSNE Project Week (18-22 October, 2021)
The very first "MSNE Project Week" is a digital scientific event being curated by a group of seven MSNE students, for MSNE students and faculty members. This week is planned to be a combination of talks, workshops, discussions, lab tours and social events to encourage the onboarding of our new batch of MSNE students. One goal is to bring together bright minds to give talks that are idea-focused and on a wide range of subjects to foster learning, inspiration, and wonder. In addition, we aim to provoke conversations that matter in the field of Neuroengineering. On top of that, visiting and seeing the labs where actual research is happening will considerably contribute to our mission. This will also profoundly connect MSNE students with the topics of Neuroengineering.
MSNE students, MSNE faculty and CoC Neuroengineering already received an invitation and registration link by email.

The Time after MSNE Graduation ... A Panel Discussion (Jan 19th 2021, 18:00)
The Time after MSNE Graduation ... A Panel Discussion (Jan 19th 2021, 18:00)
Winter 2016/17 - Pioneering in a brand-new study program, exploring opportunities and co-shaping the program by feedback and student initiatives, studying in a program which is evolving semester-wise: MSNE Alumni/Alumna Steffen Schneider,  Christoph Kocher, and Ann Kotkat are going to look back ~4.5 years, discussing their impressions on ENB MSNE Program, their time at TUM, their time in Elite Network of Bavaria, putting a focus on their year(s) after graduation. The discussion is intended to provide a student perspective on career opportunities, on time and efforts spent in the program or afterwards that turned out fruitful or a waste of time. The event is open for all MSNE students, all MSNE alumni/alumnae, and MSNE associated Faculty/Team. We would like to keep this audience fixed to this group of people.
Preparing for the event, we asked three open questions to Christoph, Steffen, and Ann:
- Being in a time capsule, given all the knowledge you have now, re-starting to MSNE: What would you do in a different way? - What have been your thoughts while deciding between PhD / Doctoral Studies at University and (research-.oriented) Industry Employment? - Kindly provide a preview on your calendar entry of Friday, Jan 19th 2024, given that all the plans you made for the next years will turn out successful!
We will meet for this Panel discussion Tuesday, Jan 19th 2021, 18:00 in Zoom. MSNE students, MSNE alumni/ae and MSNE Associated Faculty/Team will receive an personal invitation soon.
Expected end of the evening event is 20:00 (...but we will not close zoom rooms sharp by time).
