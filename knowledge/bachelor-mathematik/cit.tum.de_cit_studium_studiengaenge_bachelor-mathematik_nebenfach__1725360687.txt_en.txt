For the Master’s degree in Mathematics in Data Science, knowledge on the fundamentals of informatics is required in terms of discipline-specific qualifications. This requirement is fully met if students can verify they have completed three of the five modules: IN0001 (or CIT1230000), IN0007, IN0008, IN0009 and IN0010.

Remark
Minor in the Bachelor’s Program Mathematics > Informatics (FPSO 2023, start of studies as of Winter Semester 2023/24) > Remark
Instead of CIT123000 or CIT1230000 Introduction to Informatics for Students of Mathematics, IN0001 Introduction to Informatics and/or IN0002 Fundamentals of Programming (Exercises & Laboratory) (6CP each) may be chosen. Studyability of this alternative requires additional prerequisites and self-directed rearrangements in the curriculum.The two modules CIT123000 and CIT1230000 cannot both be included in the degree program.
