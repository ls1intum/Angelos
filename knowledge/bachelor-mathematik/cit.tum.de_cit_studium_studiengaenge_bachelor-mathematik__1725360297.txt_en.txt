Graduates of the Mathematics program have many options for their career: In banks and insurance companies, they calculate risks or create climate models. In biology, they model molecules, and they optimize routes and freight sizes at logistics companies and airlines. The bachelor's program is the cornerstone for these professions. In the program, students acquire broad methodical and theoretical knowledge.
In addition to abstract mathematical principles, you will also learn about the practical areas of application of mathematics. The Department of Mathematics at the TUM School of Computation, Information and Technology is one of the leading centers in Europe for applied and interdisciplinary mathematics. In the mathematics program, you will not only deal with analysis, algebra, geometry or probability theory, you will also address the question: Where and how is mathematics used in the natural and engineering sciences, in the economy or in other fields? After the fourth semester, you can specialize in pure mathematics or any of the major areas of applied mathematics: finance mathematics, business mathematics, techno-mathematics and mathematics for data analysis.

What do I have to consider if I am from another country?
Mathematics > What do I have to consider if I am from another country?
Please follow the instructions for international students.
In most cases, students with an international university entrance qualification must request a VPD certificate from Uni-assist; a VDP certificate confirms the equivalence of your secondary school-leaving certificate with a German higher education entrance qualification. The processing time at Uni-assist is approximately four to six 6 weeks, as a rule. However, we recommend submitting the application for a VDP certificate to be issued as soon as possible, because your application to TUM can only be processed once the VPD certificate has been submitted to us.
The application for a VPD certificate from Uni-assist must be submitted at the latest by July 15. If you have problems with meeting the application deadlines despite submitting your graduation certificate and transcripts on time to Uni-assist, please also contact bsc-app(at)ma.tum.de.
If the language of instruction at your secondary school was not German, you must, as a rule, submit verification of adequate German language skills. In accordance with the Ministry of Education, this is also the case if your native language is German and you are a German citizen. Language certificates for the verification of language skills are assessed only by the TUM Center for Study and Teaching. Please observe the list of recognized language certificates that are acceptable and send any inquiries to the contacts indicated in the list.

Fundamentals and Orientation Examinations (GOP)
Mathematics > Fundamentals and Orientation Examinations (GOP)
As of the Winter Semester 2019/20, all students in the bachelor’s degree program in mathematics must pass the Fundamentals and Orientation Examinations (GOP) in the first year of their studies.
The GOP gives all students the opportunity togain academic orientation based on the discipline-specific content of the initial modules of the mathematics program. To pass the examinations, students must demonstrate that they are familiar with the essential principles of mathematics, which is required to continue studying in the mathematics program at TUM. The Fundamentals and Orientation Examinations (GOP) are also considered an excellent indicator for the student’s future academic success. The GOP helps students get a clear understanding of the program’s requirements during the first year of their studies. Students who do not pass the GOP must leave the degree program.
